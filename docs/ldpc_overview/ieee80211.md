This section gives a brief overview of LDPC codes used in the IEEE802.11 (Wi-Fi) standard.

{% assign ieee = site.bib_sources | where:"id","ieee802.11" %}
LDPC codes were added into the standard through the 802.11n amendment from 2009, which allowed raw throughput
of up to 600 Mbit/s. Among the introduced features, the standard adopted LDPC codes as an optional channel coding scheme
which can replace the otherwise used scheme of convolutional codes. 

More details are available the standard's [pdf]({{ieee[0].url}}). Details specific to the LDPC codes used appear 
on pages 2902-2906, and the parity check matrices appear on pages 4130-4132.
